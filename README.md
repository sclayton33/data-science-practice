### Deep Learning 1
  The notebooks listed here are based on part 1 of the course. They may include additional or modified cells as a result of experimenting with different settings and techniques. All of these notebooks were run in Jupyter Lab on my local machine in an Anaconda environment set up for deep learning work. The times shown for training correlate to a GTX 1080TI GPU.
  
- FastaiDL1Practice_MNISTdigits.ipynb - Practice image classification on MNIST handwritten digit dataset.
- FastaiDL1Practice_Pets.ipynb - From lesson 1, classifies breed of cats and dogs.
- FastaiDL1Practice_DatasetsfromImages.ipynb - Classifies different images pulled from image search, in this case lions, tigers, and cheetahs. Achieved 0.008333 error rate (99.17% accuracy).
- FastaiDL1Practice_Multilabel_Planets.ipynb - Classifies images with multiple labels per image. Uses planets dataset from Kaggle.
- FastaiDL1Practice_ImageSegmentation.ipynb - Uses CamVid dataset.
- FastaiDL1Practice_HeadPose.ipynb - Estimates the center of the face for various head poses. Uses BIWI dataset.
- FastaiDL1Practice_IMDB.ipynb - A sentiment analysis NLP model based on up to 100,000 IMDB movie reviews.
- FastaiDL1Practice_Tabular.ipynb - Brief example of importing and training on tabular data.
- FastaiDL1Practice_CollabFiltering.ipynb - Collaborative filtering using the MovieLens 100k dataset.
- FastaiDL1Practice_MNIST_SGD.ipynb - Applying SGD and some other optimizations to the MNIST handwritten digit dataset. 
- FastaiDL1Practice_PetsHeatmap.ipynb - Creating a heatmap overlayed onto images to identify areas of highest activation.
